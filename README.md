# [Links Worth Visiting](https://idrinth.github.io/lwv/)

Having passed along the same group of links again and again, this is now a collection of the most useful talks and resources.

Having a link in here doesn't mean I agree completely with all points raised, it just means it's worth listening to and thinking about.

If you find something wrong, have a link that should be in or want to improve the styling, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.

I hope this repository is of use for you.
